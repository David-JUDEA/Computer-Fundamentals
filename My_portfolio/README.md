# Portfolio

This project is a responsive personal portfolio website developed as part of a web development project. It showcases my projects, technical skills, and professional experience.

The site is built primarily with **Bootstrap 5**, along with **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript**.

## Implemented Features

Based on the current development state, the website includes:

- **Responsive Navigation:** A fixed `navbar` that adapts to mobile screens (hamburger menu) and desktop.
- **Hero Section:** An introduction area with a profile picture and a short description.
- **Project Gallery:** Usage of Bootstrap `Cards` to display various projects (The Right Price, Bubble Sort, Shell Script).
- **Experience & Skills:** A structured display of professional history and technical skills (Bash, Python, etc.).
- **Contact Section:** Direct links to Email, LinkedIn, and GitHub.
- **JavaScript Interactivity:** Dynamic navbar styling (shadow effect) upon scrolling.
- **Custom CSS:** Hover effects on project cards and smooth scrolling behavior.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic page structure.
- **Bootstrap 5.3.8**: CSS framework for responsive design and components (Grid, Cards, Navbar).
- **CSS3**: Custom styling (`style.css`).
- **JavaScript**: DOM manipulation for scroll events (`script.js`).
