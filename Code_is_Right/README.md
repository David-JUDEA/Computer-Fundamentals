## Project status
The project is finish but we can add some features or strengthened in the future.
The program is still bad quality and we could do a well constructed code with a bit more research.


For exemple : a interface with Tkinder to be more appealing for the player, a menu or a difficulty mode. Reconstructed the program for better quality.
